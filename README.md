## Fun fact 🐉
Early in my life I discovered that I had a very odd talent: 

I can remember and write down the first `151` pokemon names without access to the internet in a piece of paper in less than 1 hour.
In order to not lose that talent, I set a reminder to do so once a year.

`June 1st, 2021`: 45 minutes 32 seconds. I had a hard time remembering `Porygon` 😂.
